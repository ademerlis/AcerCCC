Acropora_006522,"Transcriptional regulator. Recognizes and binds to the DNA sequence 5'-GCG(T G)GGGCG-3'(EGR-site) in the promoter region of target genes. Binds double-stranded target DNA, irrespective of the cytosine methylation status. Regulates the transcription of numerous target genes, and thereby plays an important role in regulating the response to growth factors, DNA damage, and ischemia. Plays a role in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation and cell death",25208.155770064262,0.6099824851283764,0.7511750231218772,0.04309318282175476,0.30798648744392615
